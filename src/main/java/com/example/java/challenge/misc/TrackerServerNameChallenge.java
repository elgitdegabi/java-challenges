/**
 * Server Label Tracker
 * Physical servers used by our project are labeled using printed labels, with exactly one label being attached
 * to a server at any given time. Each label consists of an alphabetic host type (e.g. "apibox") concatenated with
 * the server number, with server numbers allocated sequentially (so, the first label will be "apibox:1", next one "apibox:2", etc).
 * As servers are provisioned and deprovisioned, the labels get attached and detached; detached labels can later
 * be reused for the same host type.
 * We would like to keep the total number of labels printed to a minimum (weâ€™re environmentally friendly!).
 * We would also like to maintain sequential numbering to the extent possible, so when we need a label, we always pick the one with the lowest number.
 * Your task is to write a label tracking class with two operations, "attach(hostType)" and  "detach(label)".
 * The former should return the next label to use, while the latter should return the label back into the pool
 * For example:
 * Case 1: "a", "b", "a" -> "a:1", "b:1", "a:2"
